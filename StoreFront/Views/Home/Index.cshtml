    <h2>Testimonials</h2>

        <li>
            Margory Perez -  The virus removal was top notch. My husband goes to a lot of porn sites, <br />
            if you know what I mean, and our computer was just riddled with viruses. <br />
            but Racer hand inspected and got them all removed. The cost was a little more than the guy who <br />
            just runs a virus scan on your computer and then charges you $100 without really testing to see <br />
            if the virus removal was successful. He got the job done right and even repaired a driver issue that <br />
            fixed my bluetooth at no extra charge.<br /><br />
        </li>

            Bobby Harris Jr. - I bought this sick custom computer with real name brand components for <br />
            for just a little more money than my buddy who bought his at a big box store, <br />
            and because of the great case with good cooling my computer is running great <br />
            while my buddies overheated and burned out just after the warranty expired. <br />
            Well I say "FUCK HIM" and his clan with their crappy computers if they think <br />
            they are so good they can kick out all their real friends who miss one headshot <br />
            in one competative match. They deserve their crappy prefab gaming computers. We need to <br />
            keep this place a secret. I say FUCK-EM-ALL! <br /><br />

            Loretta Shinglemeyer - My laptop always seemed low on battery power and I was dead set <br />
            a new more powerful battery to fix my trusty old laptop. However, after the technician <br />
            educated me about how with the energy saving and performance advances available today <br />
            it would "be a waste of time to put a new battery in that broke down old peice of shit." <br />
            Instead, I bought a new computer that is lighter, the picture is clearer, and the battery <br />
            lasts almost 10 times as long. Sometimes it's hard to hear the truth, but the honesty of <br />
            technician saved me a lot of money because most places would be happy to have me waste money <br />
            on a new battery to take my money even if it didn't fix the problem. <br/>
            Thanks Racer! <br /><br />
